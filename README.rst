Egoist Overlay
================

Overlay of ebuilds related to Funtoo Ego, including a refactored version
of ego itself. 

This overlay is for development use only: if it ever meets Funtoo standards,
ebuilds will be included in the portage tree.

Currently, the overlay aims to add the following features to ego/ego modules:

1) Allow ego to handle multiple versions of ego modules, in a fashion similar
to eselect, and canonical to protage SLOT/SUBSLOT notation. 

2) Allow epro to handle profiles coming from multiple repositories.

To contribute bug reports for this overlay, you can open up a GitHub issue or send
me a pull request.

If you are using ebuilds in this overlay as part of Funtoo Linux (because they are
merged into the main Funtoo Linux Portage tree, for example,) then
please also open an issue at `bugs.funtoo.org`_.

Happy hacking!
